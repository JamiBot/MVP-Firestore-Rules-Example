## Installation

Download or clone this project, then run `npm i` from the project directory to install its dependencies. Also do the same thing from within the functions folder. Not familiar with NPM? Check out my [NPM Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzs-N5hXGuQ).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
